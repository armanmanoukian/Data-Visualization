ðŸ“š Influence of People's Age on Reading Frequency

This project explores how people's habits evolve with age by analyzing two different datasets and presenting them through interactive R Shiny dashboards.
ðŸ“Š Datasets

    Dataset 1: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset captures global reading behavior, highlighting how age influences both reading frequency and genre preferences.

    Dataset 2: A local dataset of Armenian cardholder sales transactions, providing insight into how age, gender, and time impact shopping behavior.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Packages

The dashboards were built using R and the following packages:

    shiny

    ggplot2

    plotly

    dplyr

    lubridate

    moments

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

A wide variety of visual outputs were created to reveal trends and distributions:

    Scatter Plots

    Bar Charts

    Histograms

    Boxplots

    Line Graphs

    Density Plots

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

By comparing global reading patterns with local consumer behavior, the project highlights how age plays a crucial role in shaping both:

    Intellectual consumption (reading habits and genres)

    Financial behavior (shopping patterns by time, age group, and gender)

ðŸ“‚ Structure

    ui.R and server.R: Code for the Shiny apps

    cleaned_data.csv: Preprocessed dataset for global reading behavior

    final_structured_cardholders1.csv: Cleaned Armenian transaction dataset

    Visualizations and metrics are organized into multiple interactive tabs
