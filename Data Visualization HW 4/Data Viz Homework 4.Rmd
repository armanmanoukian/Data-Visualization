Part 1: Trend Analysis (R or Python)
1. Analyse trend of goals per season. For example total goals per match, average goals per match. (Python
or R)
2. Goal Distribution Per Season. Use appropriate type of graphs for goals per match, year-wise. Color-
code by whether average is above or below 2.5 (over/under bet threshold).
3. Create line charts for each season. Visualize trend of goals for each team that played in that season.
Highlight only Bayern Munchen with red color. Rest should be gray. Add appropriate title that will
contain information about season and total scored goals. Add footnote mentioning total number of
goals scored by Bayern Munchen for that season. Save all graphs in pdf.

Part 3: (R or Python)
1. Team Trajectories and Volatility
• Seasonal Position Trajectories
• Line plots showissng seasonal ranks for top 6 teams.
• Annotate title-winning seasons.
2. Volatility Index
• For each team, calculate standard deviation of final rank over all seasons.
• Use a bar chart with conditional coloring (e.g., red = unstable, green = consistent).
• Add text labels above each bar with exact values.

Part 4: Rivalries & Big Match Patterns (R or Python)
1. Head-to-Head Matrix for Selected Rivalries
• Select 5 key rivalries more info click here .
• Create a facet grid of win/draw/loss bar charts per rivalry.
• Annotate biggest win margins.
2. Upset Visualizer
2
• Define “upset” as a team >8 places below beating a top-5 team.
• Scatterplot of upsets: x-axis = rank difference, y-axis = goal difference.
• Encode team colors; highlight and label famous upsets
Note you can define top 5 by most points, most scorred goals, less consided goals.

Part 5: Overall performance (R and Python)
• Define unique color for each team per season. For each season create horizontal bar plot using total
number of points. Highlighting the winner with the unique color that you assigned to it. Save all
graphs in pdf. (R)
• Redo the same task in python. But instead of total points use goal difference. Use same logic for colors
as in first part. (Python)


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assign unique colors to teams
team_colors <- bundesliga2 %>%
  distinct(TEAM) %>%
  mutate(Color = sample(colors(), n(), replace = FALSE))

seasonal_data <- bundesliga2 %>%
  left_join(team_colors, by = "TEAM")

pdf("Overall_Performance_Points_R.pdf", width = 10, height = 6)

for (s in sort(unique(seasonal_data$SEASON))) {
  season_df <- filter(seasonal_data, SEASON == s)
  winner <- season_df %>% filter(POSITION == 1) %>% pull(TEAM)

  gg <- ggplot(season_df, aes(x = reorder(TEAM, POINTS), y = POINTS)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = TEAM == winner)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray", season_df$Color[season_df$TEAM == winner])) +

Part 6. Monte Carlo simulation. (R or Python)
Use Monte Carlo simulation to predict how many goals will Bayern Munchen score for next 10 seasons. Re-
peat the same for Bayer Leverkusen and Borusia Dortmund. Compare results using appropriate visualization
technique.
